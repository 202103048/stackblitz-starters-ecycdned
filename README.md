2048 is a popular single-player puzzle game. The gameâ€™s objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and the player moves the tiles by swiping in the desired direction.

Each move combines adjacent tiles with the same number, and new tiles with the number 2 or 4 appear randomly on the board. The game ends when the player successfully creates a 2048 tile, or when the board is full and there are no more moves available.
